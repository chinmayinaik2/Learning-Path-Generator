        Generate a detailed plan that is broken down into a daily schedule based on the total time frame provided.
        The output must be a clean JSON object and nothing else.
        The top-level JSON object must have a single key "dailyPlan".
        The value of "dailyPlan" should be an array of day objects.
        Each day object in the array must contain two keys:
        1. "day" (number): The day number in the schedule.
        2. "tasks" (array): A list of task objects for that day.

        Each task object in the "tasks" array must have the following three keys:
        - "title" (string): A concise, descriptive title for the task.
        - "description" (string): A one or two-sentence explanation of what to do for this task.
        - "exampleLink" (string): A single, high-quality, real URL to a helpful resource for this task.

        Ensure the entire learning path realistically fits within the user's specified time frame.
